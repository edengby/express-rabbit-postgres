That's an application using TypeScript, added Swagger for API documentation, and used Zod for schema validation. The code follows best practices and is structured for maintainability and scalability.

Next Steps:

Implement Advanced Features: Enhance the update mechanism, add device management capabilities, and improve logging.
Security Enhancements: Secure the communication channels and API endpoints.
Performance Optimization: Optimize RabbitMQ configurations for higher throughput.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure system reliability.
Feel free to customize and expand upon this foundation to meet your specific requirements. If you need further assistance or have questions about any part of the implementation, don't hesitate to ask!
